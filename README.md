# **Cinesphere - Movie Discovery App**  

A React-based web application for discovering movies, viewing details, and managing favorites. Built as part of a **React.js course task** at **ITI (Information Technology Institute)**. This was my **first hands-on experience with React.js**, and it helped me grasp core concepts like components, state management, routing, and API integration.
